PACKAGER CAN’T LISTEN ON PORT 8081 – $ REACT-NATIVE START –PORT=8088
I experience this error Packager can’t listen on port 8081 – $react-native start-port=8088 because I have an existing connection with a command line interface and I was trying to connect again using another CLI.

This can also happen if another process or software is using that port.

REACT NATIVE ERROR CANNOT FIND MODULE ‘./ASSETS/EMPTY-MODULE.JS’
The react native error cannot find module ‘./assets/empty-module.js’ usually occur when the server is not running.
You can solve this issue by starting the server using the command – react-native start

REACT NATIVE MISMATCH ERROR: JAVASCRIPT VERSION: 0.50.3 NATIVE VERSION 0.49.5
The error message in this situation is easy to understand. This normally happens when you update your react native version or when you use framework or module that contain a lower version of Javascript than react native.
1. One option is to downgrade your React Native version that is compatible with the native version.
2. You can upgrade all your dependencies
